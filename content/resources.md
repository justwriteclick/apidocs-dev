## Standards

[OpenAPI Specification](https://www.openapis.org/)

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is an industry standard for describing REST APIs.
For background, in 2015, SmartBear donated the OpenAPI Specification to the Linux Foundation under the OpenAPI Initiative. The specification creates a RESTful interface for both developing and consuming an API by specifying how to map all the resources and operations associated with the API using a JSON or YAML file. There are currently two specifications: [OAS 2.0](https://swagger.io/specification/v2/) and [OAS 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/).

[Swagger online editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)
Document and design your API with this open source editor for the OpenAPI Specification.

[JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/?code=)
[JSON Formatter & Validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/)
JSON online validators for either pasted JSON or pasted URL of a JSON file.
