## Where to find examples 

A great place to learn about all types of API examples is the [API Evangelist site](https://apievangelist.com). Kin Lane is the author and [the blog is excellent](https://apievangelist.com/blog/). 

He maintains multiple OpenAPI examples in GitHub at https://github.com/api-evangelist. As an example, there's the [Eventbrite API](https://github.com/api-evangelist/eventbrite), the [Slack API](https://github.com/api-evangelist/slack), 


An often-seen example is the "Petstore" REST API example that's used in the documetnation for Swagger tools and the OpenAPI standard example. The JSON file is available at 

## API Stylebook
